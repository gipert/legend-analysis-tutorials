## working-on-remote-machines

This tutorial covers tools and tricks on how to work on remote machines,
including site-specific instructions on how to load the LEGEND software

## tier-data

This tutorial provides an introduction on how to access to LEGEND data and
retrieve objects such as waveforms or DSP parameters. It also shows how to plot
these objects

# processing-data/

This tutorial shows how to manually process the `daq` files into `raw` and then `dsp`. 
Instruction on how to use the automatic tools for data production can be found
under: https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-prodenv and https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-dataflow-hades

## build_dsp

This tutorial focus on the digital signal processing, i.e. the creation of the
dsp tier. It provides an introduction to the configuration of the processing
chain, i.e. the chains of `pygama` processors that ran over the waveforms. It
also shows how to implement new processors
